# Temp Convert

This is a command line application to convert temperatures, licensed 
under the GPLv3 (please see LICENSE.txt for more information). When the
application is called, it is given an argument to show what type of
temperature unit is input, and what output is desired. The options are
as follows:

 --FtoC converts from fahrenheit to celsius
 --FtoK converts from fahrenheit to kelvin
 --CtoF converts from celsius to fahrenheit
 --CtoK converts from celsius to kelvin
 --KtoF converts from kelvin to fahrenheit
 --KtoC converts from kelvin to celsius

An example usage would be:

    temp_convert --FtoC 32

The result would answer that 32 degrees fahrenheit is 0 degreess celsius.
